# Other considered options

- [Audio correlations with numpy](find_with_numpy.py), taking advantage of the fact that we have [the announcer audio files](announcer/). Turned out to be very slow.
- [Audio correlations with dejavu](dejavu_chatgpt.md). Might be fast enough to be acceptable. Not tested.
- Monitoring the streak count in the player bar using OpenCV?
